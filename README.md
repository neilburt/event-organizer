## Installation  
  
Simply install Node.js, open the terminal, run 'npm install' and then 'npm start' from the directory command line. The local host version can then be accessed via browser at http://localhost:3001. Or just visit the link to the deployed app on Heroku in the [Usage](#usage) section below and sidestep installation altogether!  
  
## Usage  
  
Once the application is called by typing 'npm start' in the terminal, the user can load the app in their browser with the localhost:3001 address, click the signup link, and create an account to search for an event by zipcode and save it or create their own.  
  
Check out the [deployed app](https://gentle-reaches-60799.herokuapp.com/) at Heroku.
